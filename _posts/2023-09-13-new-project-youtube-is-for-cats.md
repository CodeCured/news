I'm technically writing this post from the future... but Code Cured's first project has been released! It's a simple proof-of-concept modification of an existing project, featuring the best content on earth: [Cat videos on YouTube](https://youtube.codecured.org/).

Admittedly this project was mostly to check CodeCured.org and the GitHub organisation all worked OK, and happily they seem fine. The project is very simple, just a list of cat-related YouTube channels, with automatically updating metadata.

The [source code](https://github.com/CodeCured/YouTubeIsForCats/) is of course available, and it's a direct modification of my previous [Jerma](https://channels.jerma.io) and [Yogscast](https://yogscast.jakelee.co.uk) YouTube projects. If you're curious, [here's how the updating works](https://blog.jakelee.co.uk/fetching-youtube-metadata-in-github-actions-and-persisting/).

Now that the basic framework is there I can ~~pretend watching cat videos is time well spent~~ do important research to find new channels! 

One last time, here's the link: **[youtube.codecured.org](https://youtube.codecured.org)**
